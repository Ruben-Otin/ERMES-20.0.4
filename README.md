## 🔭 Overview

ERMES is an open-source C++ finite element (FEM) code that solves Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. Version 20.0.4 is a major upgrade, adding new modules, FEM formulations and HPC capabilities aimed at the demanding electromagnetic problems found in the design and analysis of nuclear fusion reactors.

ERMES works across the **static, quasi-static and high-frequency** regimes. It has been applied to microwave engineering, bioelectromagnetics, electromagnetic compatibility and electromagnetic forming, and, through its electrostatic and cold-plasma modules, to fusion problems such as plasma disruption induced currents and forces, plasma control, electric-arc initiation, and wave–plasma–wall interaction.

The graphical user interface is fully integrated into the pre/post-processor **[GiD](https://www.gidsimulation.com)**, which handles geometry, data input, meshing, and visualisation. GiD is the recommended option for setting up simulations and post-processing results, but it is not required. Any pre-processor can be used, provided that it generates the ERMES input files in the format described in the manual.

## ✨ Features

### 🧮 FEM formulations

| Formulation | Elements | A–φ potentials | Lagrange-multiplier stabilisation |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| Regularized Maxwell's equations | Nodal | ✅ | — |
| Double-curl Maxwell's equations | Edge | ✅ | ✅ (switchable) |
| Local L² projection method | Nodal + bubble | ✅ | ✅ (switchable) |

Having several formulations lets you pick the most stable one for each problem and produce the best-conditioned matrix, which can often be solved with low-memory iterative methods. The regularized nodal formulation includes dedicated treatment of field **discontinuities** and **singularities**.

### 🧱 Materials
- **IHL materials** — isotropic, homogeneous, linear media
- **Cold plasma** — configurable plasma geometry, composition and problem settings

### ⚡ Sources
- **Volumetric current densities J** — Cartesian, axisymmetric, combined Cartesian + axisymmetric, helicoidal, and plasma modes
- **Boundary sources** — rectangular waveguide ports (TE10), coaxial ports (TEM), plane waves, Gaussian beams, quasi-static and electrostatic current fluxes

### 🧭 Boundary conditions
- **Dirichlet** — PEC, PMC, TEC, periodic/cyclic (PBC), full-wave voltage, electrostatic voltage, singularity
- **Robin** — full-wave and cold-plasma far-field conditions (FW, RW, LW, PW waves), plane-wave / Gaussian-beam / quasi-static Robin coefficients, imported Robin data, electrostatic Robin, coaxial TEM and RW-port TE10

### 📊 Outputs
- Frequency-domain, time-domain, cold-plasma and electrostatic field visualisation
- Surface and volume integrals, scattering parameters, and fields-on-nodes files
- Results in GiD format, plus generic formats adaptable to other post-processors

### 🚀 Solvers & HPC
- Built-in **BiCG** and **TFQMR** iterative solvers with diagonal preconditioning and **OpenMP**
- **PETSc interface** that reads the ERMES system directly and in parallel, and solves it using direct or iterative solvers over **MPI** on workstations or SLURM clusters, with no Python or intermediate files.
- Interface to **Python NumPy**, with scripts to export the linear system in other formats
- Editable `.dat` input files and batch/Python scripts for parametric and cluster runs

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Install GiD
Download the latest GiD from [gidsimulation.com](https://www.gidsimulation.com), then register it via **Help → Register GiD** (local, USB, floating or named-user licence; a one-month free licence is available and renewable).

### 2. Install ERMES
Copy the entire `ERMES_20.0.4` folder into GiD's `problemtypes` directory (e.g. C:\MySoftware\GiD 16.0.2\problemtypes). Then, restart GiD and select **Data → Problem type → ERMES_20.0.4 → ERMES**. The ERMES logo and menu bar should appear. The same procedure applies to Windows and Linux.

### 3. Install PETSc
For high-performance computing and large problems, use the ERMES–PETSc interface in `Utilities/PETSc_Direct`. See installation details in **[ERMES–PETSc interface](#petsc)** below.

## ⚡ ERMES–PETSc interface

`ERMESPETScSolver` reads the ERMES linear system **A X₀ = B** directly and in parallel, solves it with **[PETSc](https://petsc.org)**, and writes the solution `Vector_Xo.bin` back for ERMES. **No Python and no intermediate files** are needed.

📁 Source: [`Utilities/PETSc_Direct`](https://github.com/Ruben-Otin/ERMES-20.0.4/tree/main/Utilities/PETSc_Direct)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ERMESPETScSolver.cpp` | Solver source code |
| `makefile` | Builds the solver |
| `ERMES2PETSc.sh` | Script called by ERMES (all settings at the top) |

### 📥 Files read from the problem folder

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `Matrix_A_cmplx.bin`, `Matrix_A_int.bin` | System matrix (coefficients, indices) |
| `Matrix_A_aux_cmplx.bin`, `Matrix_A_aux_int.bin` | Auxiliary matrix (Hermitic formats) |
| `Vector_B.bin` | Right-hand side |

### 🔍 Matrix formats (detected automatically)

| Format | `Matrix_A` | `Matrix_A_aux` |
|---|---|---|
| **Symmetric** | Diagonal + upper triangle of a complex symmetric matrix | — |
| **Full-matrix** | Entire matrix | — |
| **Hermitic-Symmetric** | Diagonal + upper triangle of the Hermitian volumetric contribution | Diagonal + upper triangle of the complex symmetric Robin boundary contribution |
| **Hermitic-Full** | As above | Entire Robin contribution, added as stored |

If `Matrix_A_aux` files are present the format is Hermitic, and the number of stored triangles selects the variant. The detected format is printed in the `*.info` file.

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# 1. Download PETSc
git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git petsc

# 2. Environment (also needed before compiling the solver;
#    use the same PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH in section 1 of ERMES2PETSc.sh)
export PETSC_DIR=$HOME/petsc
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-complex-M1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# 3. Configure PETSc (several configurations can coexist, one per PETSC_ARCH)
cd $PETSC_DIR
./configure PETSC_ARCH=arch-complex-M1 \
  --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran \
  --with-debugging=0 --with-scalar-type=complex --with-64-bit-indices=1 \
  --download-mpich --download-hwloc --download-openblas \
  --download-scalapack --download-mumps \
  --download-metis --download-parmetis --download-ptscotch \
  --download-cmake --download-bison --download-make
#    ...then run the "make" commands printed at the end of configure

# 4. Compile the solver (inside Utilities/PETSc_Direct)
make ERMESPETScSolver

# 5. Execution permissions
chmod +x *.sh ERMESPETScSolver
```

### ▶️ Use from ERMES

In ERMES, set **Solver type** to **External solver** and enter in **External solvers settings**:

| OS | Command |
|---|---|
| 🐧 Linux | `bash /path_to/PETSc_Direct/ERMES2PETSc.sh` |
| 🪟 Windows | `wsl bash /path_to/PETSc_Direct/ERMES2PETSc.sh` |

ERMES runs the script from the problem folder. Inside a **SLURM** job, the solver runs on all the nodes and tasks of the job. All solver output, including errors, goes to the ERMES `*.info` file.

The script can also be run without ERMES, from a folder that contains the matrix and vector files:

```bash
cd /path_to/problem_folder
bash /path_to/PETSc_Direct/ERMES2PETSc.sh
```

For more information, see README.txt in `Utilities/PETSc_Direct` or visit [petsc.org](https://petsc.org).

GiD is recommended but not required. Any pre-processor can be used as long as it writes the `.dat` input files in the format defined by the `.bas` templates in `ERMES_20.0.4/ERMES.gid`. Those `.dat` files can also be edited directly for parametric batch runs.
