This folder contains three ready-to-open GiD projects that show how a
complete ERMES problem is set up: problem data, materials, boundary
conditions, sources and requested results. They are intended as a starting
point for new users and as templates for new models.

- Eddy_Currents.gid    : Low-frequency eddy currents (A-V potentials, 50 Hz)
- Microwave_Filter.gid : Rectangular waveguide filter with TE10 ports (9 GHz)
- SAM-Head.gid         : Plane-wave illumination of a head phantom (1 GHz)

Each example uses a different FEM formulation, excitation and set of
boundary conditions, so together they cover the most common ways of driving
an ERMES simulation.

*******************************************************************************
* - HOW TO OPEN AND RUN AN EXAMPLE
*******************************************************************************

1. Install GiD and the ERMES problem type (see the main ERMES documentation).
2. In GiD go to  File > Open  and select one of the *.gid folders.
   GiD treats the whole folder as a single project; do not open the
   individual files inside it.
3. Explore the set-up (see section 2).
4. Generate the mesh:  Mesh > Generate mesh.
   The examples are distributed WITHOUT a mesh to keep the folder small,
   so this step is required before calculating.
5. Run the analysis:  Calculate > Calculate.
6. When the calculation finishes, switch to post-processing
   (Files > Postprocess, or the pre/post toggle button) to visualise the
   results.

Tip: before modifying an example, save a copy with  File > Save as  so the
original project remains unchanged.

*******************************************************************************
 2. WHAT TO EXPLORE IN EACH PROJECT
*******************************************************************************

- Problem data (Data > Problem data):
    Problem mode, symmetry, FEM formulation (element type, A-V potentials
    on/off), length units, frequency, solver settings and the list of
    results to be written. Every field has a help text explaining the
    available options.

- Materials (Data > Materials):
    IHL materials (conductivity, permittivity, permeability), cold plasma,
    port definitions (rectangular and coaxial), Robin coefficients (plane
    waves, Gaussian beams...), current-source definitions and integration
    regions. Use the "Draw" option in the materials window to see which
    volume each material is assigned to.

- Conditions (Data > Conditions):
    Dirichlet conditions (PEC, PMC, TEC, PBC, voltages), Robin conditions
    (far field, full-wave Robin, ports), field integrals and current
    sources. Use the "Draw" option in the conditions window to highlight
    the entities where each condition has been applied.

All values are given in SI units (length units: m).

 6. NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mesh density: the element size must resolve the wavelength in every
  material (and the skin depth in conductors). If you increase the
  frequency, refine the mesh accordingly.

- Solver: the examples use the built-in iterative solver with 8 processors
  ("Processors" field in Problem data); adjust it to your machine. For large
  models the "External_solver" option can be used to export the system and
  solve it with an external tool (see the Utilities folder of the ERMES
  distribution, e.g. the PETSc-based solver).

- Help: hovering over / clicking the help icon next to any field in the
  Problem data, Materials or Conditions windows shows a description of the
  option and its allowed values.
